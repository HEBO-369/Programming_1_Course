## 📚 Course Overview

This repository contains the full set of lab assignments for the course **CS121: Computer Programming 1**. The course aims to build a strong foundation in the C programming language, covering core programming concepts including variables, operators, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, dynamic memory, recursion, and structures.

Each lab includes a set of practical problems designed to reinforce theoretical understanding through hands-on implementation.
