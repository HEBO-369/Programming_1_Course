# 🔁 Lab 2 - Loops Practice

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

1. Get familiar with the C programming language.
2. Practice solving problems using loops.

## 🧩 Problem Set Description

This lab focuses on applying loop constructs to solve real programming problems using the C language. Each task emphasizes logic building, iterative control structures, and input/output handling.

## 📌 Exercises

1. **Factorial Calculator**  
   - Given an integer `n` (where `n ≤ 12`), the program calculates and prints `n!` (n factorial).

2. **Reverse Even/Odd Number Sequence**  
   - The user enters an integer `n`.
     - If `n` is even → print all even numbers from `n` down to `2`.
     - If `n` is odd → print all odd numbers from `n` down to `1`.  
   - **Example:**
     - Input: `n = 10` → Output: `10 8 6 4 2`
     - Input: `n = 5` → Output: `5 3 1`

3. **Sum of Natural Numbers**  
   - The program scans a positive integer `N` and calculates the sum from `1` to `N`.  
   - **Bonus:** Implement a version using only **one expression**.

4. **Sine Function Approximation**  
   - The program reads:
     - A value `x` (in degrees)
     - A value `N` (number of terms)
   - Then computes the sine of `x` by summing the first `N` terms of its Taylor series expansion:
   - The value of `x` should be converted from degrees to radians before computation.

All problems are designed to build logical thinking and hands-on experience with iteration constructs in C programming.
