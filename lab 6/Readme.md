# ðŸ§® Lab 6 - Structs & Revision

## ðŸŽ¯ Lab Objectives

1. Get familiar with the C programming language.
2. Practice using `struct` in C and revisit previous core topics like loops, arrays, and functions.

## ðŸ§© Problem Set Description

This lab focuses on using user-defined data types (`struct`) and reinforcing previously covered concepts through practical implementation. The tasks include arithmetic operations on fractions, array manipulation, big integer multiplication, and creative function-based solutions.

## ðŸ“Œ Exercises

1. **Rational Number Operations**  
   Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two rational numbers using a custom `Fraction` structure. Each result should be reduced to its simplest form using a `gcd` function.

2. **Circular Right Shift**  
   Given an array and a number `k`, perform a circular right shift of the array `k` times.

3. **Big Integer Multiplication**  
   Multiply two very large integers represented as strings (up to 1000 digits each) without using built-in big number libraries.

4. **Bonus - Swap Without Temp Variable**  
   Swap two integers using XOR operations without using a third variable.

5. **Bonus - Time Conversion**  
   Given a number of seconds since midnight, implement a function to convert and return a structured time format (hours, minutes, seconds) using a custom `Time` struct.

This lab is designed to bring together various skills acquired throughout the course â€” especially struct usage, modular functions, input handling, and memory-safe logic.
