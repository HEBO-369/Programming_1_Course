# ðŸ“˜ CS121 - Problem Set: Variables, Operators, Selection

## ðŸ“„ Overview

This project includes four programming exercises designed to practice the fundamental concepts of:

- Variables and data types
- Arithmetic and logical operators
- Conditional selection (if-else, switch)
- Bit manipulation and memory efficiency
- Basic input/output operations

All tasks are implemented in **C language**, with clear input validation and user interaction.

## ðŸ§© Problem Set Contents

1. **Circle Calculator**  
   A program that calculates and displays different properties of a circle (diameter, circumference, area) based on the user's choice.

2. **Expression Evaluator**  
   A program that takes input values from the user and evaluates a set of predefined mathematical expressions.

3. **Bit-Level Compression**  
   A memory-efficient technique to store two 4-bit integers inside a single `char` by using bitwise operations.

4. **Leap Year Checker**  
   A program that checks if a given year is a leap year based on the well-known leap year rules.
