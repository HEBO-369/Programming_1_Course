# 🧷 Lab - Pointers & Dynamic Memory Allocation

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

1. Get familiar with the C programming language.
2. Practice using pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

## 🧩 Problem Set Description

This lab introduces pointers in C, along with the usage of dynamic memory allocation through `malloc` and `calloc`. The problems focus on applying pointers for accessing and manipulating data, as well as working with memory-efficient solutions using heap allocation.

## 📌 Exercises

1. **Add Using Pointers**  
   A program that demonstrates how to add two numbers using pointers.

2. **Array Access via Pointers**  
   Store and print `n` array elements using pointer notation.

3. **Sum with malloc vs calloc**  
   Two programs to calculate the sum of `n` numbers — one using `malloc` and the other using `calloc`.

4. **Max Row at the Top**  
   A program that reads a 2D array and moves the row with the highest sum to the top. The solution uses pointers and dynamic memory allocation to handle the array.

---

All problems in this lab reinforce how pointers can be used to handle memory directly and efficiently, and how to manage arrays dynamically using C standard library functions.
