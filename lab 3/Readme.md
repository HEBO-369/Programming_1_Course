# 🔁 Lab 3 - Loops & Arrays Practice

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

1. Get familiar with the C programming language.
2. Practice solving problems involving loops and arrays.

## 🧩 Problem Set Description

This lab consists of three programming problems designed to reinforce your understanding of loops, arrays, and structured problem-solving in C. The tasks involve interactive logic building, data storage using arrays, and data manipulation techniques such as set operations and averaging.

## 📌 Exercises

1. **Guessing Game**  
   A number guessing game implemented using a `do-while` loop, where the user keeps guessing until the correct number is found.

2. **Job Titles and Salaries**  
   A program that reads job titles and salary ranges, stores them in arrays, calculates average salaries, and identifies the lowest and highest average salary.

3. **Union and Intersection of Arrays**  
   A program that reads two arrays of integers from the user, removes duplicates, and computes the union and intersection of the arrays.

---

All problems are designed to build foundational skills in C programming, with a focus on using arrays effectively and controlling program flow using loops.
