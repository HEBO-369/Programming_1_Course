# 🔁 Lab 5 - Recursion & Strings

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

1. Get familiar with the C programming language.
2. Practice using functions and recursion.
3. Work with strings and basic text manipulation.

## 🧩 Problem Set Description

This lab introduces recursion and string processing in C. The problems cover various concepts such as digit manipulation through recursion, word counting in a text line, and string pattern searching. The goal is to strengthen understanding of function calls, memory handling in strings, and working with textual data.

## 📌 Exercises

1. **Sum of Digits (Recursive)**  
   A recursive function that calculates the sum of digits for a given number.

2. **Count the Words**  
   A program that reads a full line of text from the user and counts the number of words present, handling spaces and tabs correctly.

3. **String Occurrence Finder**  
   A program that reads a full line of text and a target word, then finds and prints all starting indices where the word occurs within the line, as well as the total number of matches.

All tasks are designed to strengthen your understanding of recursive logic and string manipulation in C.
