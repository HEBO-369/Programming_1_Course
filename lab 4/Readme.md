# ðŸ§  Lab 4 - 2D Arrays & Functions

## ðŸŽ¯ Lab Objectives

1. Get familiar with the C programming language.
2. Practice solving problems using loops.
3. Understand and apply user-defined functions in C.

## ðŸ§© Problem Set Description

This lab focuses on deepening your understanding of arrays (including 2D arrays) and custom functions in C programming. It includes a mix of mathematical computations, logical checks, and structured data manipulation using modular code design.

## ðŸ“Œ Exercises

1. **Matrix Transposition**  
   Work with 2D arrays to compute the transpose of a matrix given its dimensions and values.

2. **Decimal to Binary Conversion**  
   Convert a decimal number to binary using a dedicated function.

3. **Prime Number Checker**  
   Check whether a given number is prime using a user-defined function.

4. **Polynomial Evaluation**  
   Write a function that evaluates a fifth-degree polynomial given the input value of `x`.

5. **Sine Calculation with Functions**  
   Revisit the sine approximation task using a structured approach:
   - A function to convert degrees to radians.
   - A custom factorial function.
   - A custom power function.
   - A final sine calculation function that calls the others.
